    """
    An implementation of the Simulated Annealing stochastic nonlinear
    optimization method.
    
    Solving optimization problems involves tweaking decision variables to try to
    minimize some cost function. Simulated annealing is good for solving
    optimization problems with many local minima and a very large search space
    (itâ€™s a heuristic solver rather than an exact solver like, say, SQP or
    interior-point method). Simulated annealing is a popular choice for solving
    the traveling salesman problem (see TravelingSalesman).

                                   it more likely a worse state will be accepted during iteration, helping
